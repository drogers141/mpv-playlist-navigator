Search is case-insensitive and uses [lua search patterns](https://www.lua.org/pil/20.2.html).
For basics it is like regular expressions '.' matches any character, and '\*' is zero or more
repetitions.  So '.\*' and substrings gets you pretty far.

## Installation

Clone repo into your [mpv scripts directory](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/User-Scripts)
